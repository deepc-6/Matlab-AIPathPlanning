# Matlab-AIPathPlanning
This Matlab program can find the best path between two points, from an image of a map.

It consists of two programs:

1) main.m: This program finds the best path by detecting obstacles in a simple static map.

2) main2.m: This program finds the best path by converting the roadmap provided to a grayscale image and using image processing to find the best path from the source to the destination.
